'''
generator is a special type of function that returns an iterator object 
which we can iterate over one value at a time. 
It is used to create iterators in a simple way. 
A generator function is defined like a normal function 
but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword i rather than return. 
If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.
yeild is used to pausing  the function than terminating it.
